Milestone,In.Vegas,"Event Feed    The core of the Portal Site centers around the event feed.    The Event Feed is a vertical feed of events appearing the same way articles would in a traditional blog feed.      Each event acts as its own standalone “article"" and contains the following elements:    Event Date - (Date of the Event — NOT the date of the post)  Event Title - (90 Characters, Default for Facebook Link Header)  Venue - (Hyperlink to Category Feed For Artist)  Artist - (Hyperlink to Category Feed for Artist)  Event Image - (1200x628 - Default for Facebook Link Image)  Buy Tickets Button - pointing to associated TicketDriver page  Reserve Table Button - pointing to associated VenueDriver form  Event Tags - Customer facing tags at the end of every article that allow them to quickly see a feed of all similarly tagged events, by: venue, artist, hotel, holiday weekend, etc.      Event Tags and Category Feeds    The Event Feed is always shown in chronological order by Event Date, however, it can be filtered according to it’s Event Tags.      Event Tags fall into several types of Categories:    Venue  Artist  Holiday Weekend/Special Event    A single event will contain multiple tags spanning these categories.    Each Event Tag should have it’s own dedicated Category Feed and permalink that the marketing team can point ads at should they choose to.      Examples:    events.hakkasangroup.com/category/omnia  (all upcoming events at OMNIA)  events.hakkasangroup.com/category/calvinharris (all upcoming events with Calvin Harris  events.hakkasangroup.com/category/halloween      Dedicated Event Pages    Each event should have it’s own dedicated event page and permalink that the marketing team can point ads at should they choose to.      Each Event page should retain the following features:    Event Date - (Date of the Event — NOT the date of the post)  Event Title - (90 Characters, Default for Facebook Link Header)  Venue - (Hyperlink to Category Feed For Artist)  Artist - (Hyperlink to Category Feed for Artist)  Event Image - (1200x628 - Default for Facebook Link Image)  Buy Tickets Button - pointing to associated TicketDriver page  Reserve Table Button - pointing to associated VenueDriver form  Event Tags - Customer facing tags at the end of every article that allow them to quickly see a feed of all similarly tagged events, by: venue, artist, hotel, holiday weekend, etc.    As well as:     Event Description - Text Field summarizing the event. This can be as many characters as we want, but it's good to keep in mind that Facebook will pull the first 90 characters for any link previews if we optimize our metadata accordingly.      Metadata    Metadata for all event pages can and should be dynamically populated based on the elements defined above. This includes Facebook Open Graph Tags, Twitter Card Tags, as well as standard Title and Description tags.     Example:    Standard    <title>Calvin Harris OMNIA Las Vegas 10/28/16</title>    <meta name=""description” content=""Calvin Harris continues his residency every Friday at Omnia Nightclub inside Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas”>    Open Graph    <meta property=""og:url"" content=""events.hakkasangroup.com"">  <meta property=""og:type"" content=""article"">  <meta property=""og:title"" content=""Calvin Harris OMNIA Las Vegas 10/28/16"">  <meta property=""og:description"" content=""Calvin Harris continues his residency every Friday at Omnia Nightclub inside Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas."">  <meta property=""og:image"" content=“calvinharrisomnia.jpg"">      Twitter Card    <meta name=""twitter:card"" content=""summary_large_image"">  <meta name=""twitter:site"" content=“events.hakkasangroup.com"">  <meta name=""twitter:title"" content=""Calvin Harris OMNIA Las Vegas 10/28/16"">  <meta name=""twitter:description"" content=""Calvin Harris continues his residency every Friday at Omnia Nightclub inside Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas."">  <meta name=""twitter:image"" content=“calvinharrisomnia.jpg"">    Note: metadata for more permanent pages such as the home page and category pages cannot be dynamically generated and must be composed from scratch with thoughtful creative and copy, optimized for both search engines and social sharability.

Task,Implement a landing page for seven-day all-access passes,"The all.in.vegas seven-day passes will be normal Venue Driver ticket ""packages"".  Those are special ticket sales where the barcode is valid at more than one event.  Stephane is going to create those manually at first, and he will add a promo code so that they will not be visible on normal ticket pages.    This would probably be simpler to accomplish by adding an all.in.vegas page to the Hakkasan Group brand with special intelligence for ignoring the promo codes and displaying these passes.  This needs to be a separate index page because normally our event ticket pages display a list of events.  Instead, we need to show a list of weeks.  We can do that by listing all of these special ticket packages instead of listing events.    How will we know which ticket packages to list?  Stephane is going to set up a special venue for this new feature, with events on Mondays.  ""All.In.Vegas"".  We can look for those Monday events in that specific venue and list those.    The landing page also needs to display the dates correctly.  We normally display one event date.  For this page we will need to display the start and end date.  Monday [month] [date] through Sunday [month] [date].    If you click on one of those packages then it should take you to the Monday event page, where it will list the male and female seven-day passes.  That event page will also need to be tweaked for these packages to show both the start and end date, as opposed to only the start date like with normal tickets.
