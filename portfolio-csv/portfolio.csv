"Milestone","In.Vegas","Event Feed    The core of the Portal Site centers around the event feed.    The Event Feed is a vertical feed of events appearing the same way articles would in a traditional blog feed.      Each event acts as its own standalone “article"" and contains the following elements:    Event Date - (Date of the Event — NOT the date of the post)  Event Title - (90 Characters, Default for Facebook Link Header)  Venue - (Hyperlink to Category Feed For Artist)  Artist - (Hyperlink to Category Feed for Artist)  Event Image - (1200x628 - Default for Facebook Link Image)  Buy Tickets Button - pointing to associated TicketDriver page  Reserve Table Button - pointing to associated VenueDriver form  Event Tags - Customer facing tags at the end of every article that allow them to quickly see a feed of all similarly tagged events, by: venue, artist, hotel, holiday weekend, etc.      Event Tags and Category Feeds    The Event Feed is always shown in chronological order by Event Date, however, it can be filtered according to it’s Event Tags.      Event Tags fall into several types of Categories:    Venue  Artist  Holiday Weekend/Special Event    A single event will contain multiple tags spanning these categories.    Each Event Tag should have it’s own dedicated Category Feed and permalink that the marketing team can point ads at should they choose to.      Examples:    events.hakkasangroup.com/category/omnia  (all upcoming events at OMNIA)  events.hakkasangroup.com/category/calvinharris (all upcoming events with Calvin Harris  events.hakkasangroup.com/category/halloween      Dedicated Event Pages    Each event should have it’s own dedicated event page and permalink that the marketing team can point ads at should they choose to.      Each Event page should retain the following features:    Event Date - (Date of the Event — NOT the date of the post)  Event Title - (90 Characters, Default for Facebook Link Header)  Venue - (Hyperlink to Category Feed For Artist)  Artist - (Hyperlink to Category Feed for Artist)  Event Image - (1200x628 - Default for Facebook Link Image)  Buy Tickets Button - pointing to associated TicketDriver page  Reserve Table Button - pointing to associated VenueDriver form  Event Tags - Customer facing tags at the end of every article that allow them to quickly see a feed of all similarly tagged events, by: venue, artist, hotel, holiday weekend, etc.    As well as:     Event Description - Text Field summarizing the event. This can be as many characters as we want, but it's good to keep in mind that Facebook will pull the first 90 characters for any link previews if we optimize our metadata accordingly.      Metadata    Metadata for all event pages can and should be dynamically populated based on the elements defined above. This includes Facebook Open Graph Tags, Twitter Card Tags, as well as standard Title and Description tags.     Example:    Standard    <title>Calvin Harris OMNIA Las Vegas 10/28/16</title>    <meta name=""description” content=""Calvin Harris continues his residency every Friday at Omnia Nightclub inside Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas”>    Open Graph    <meta property=""og:url"" content=""events.hakkasangroup.com"">  <meta property=""og:type"" content=""article"">  <meta property=""og:title"" content=""Calvin Harris OMNIA Las Vegas 10/28/16"">  <meta property=""og:description"" content=""Calvin Harris continues his residency every Friday at Omnia Nightclub inside Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas."">  <meta property=""og:image"" content=“calvinharrisomnia.jpg"">      Twitter Card    <meta name=""twitter:card"" content=""summary_large_image"">  <meta name=""twitter:site"" content=“events.hakkasangroup.com"">  <meta name=""twitter:title"" content=""Calvin Harris OMNIA Las Vegas 10/28/16"">  <meta name=""twitter:description"" content=""Calvin Harris continues his residency every Friday at Omnia Nightclub inside Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas."">  <meta name=""twitter:image"" content=“calvinharrisomnia.jpg"">    Note: metadata for more permanent pages such as the home page and category pages cannot be dynamically generated and must be composed from scratch with thoughtful creative and copy, optimized for both search engines and social sharability.

"Task","Implement a landing page for seven-day all-access passes","The all.in.vegas seven-day passes will be normal Venue Driver ticket ""packages"".  Those are special ticket sales where the barcode is valid at more than one event.  Stephane is going to create those manually at first, and he will add a promo code so that they will not be visible on normal ticket pages.    This would probably be simpler to accomplish by adding an all.in.vegas page to the Hakkasan Group brand with special intelligence for ignoring the promo codes and displaying these passes.  This needs to be a separate index page because normally our event ticket pages display a list of events.  Instead, we need to show a list of weeks.  We can do that by listing all of these special ticket packages instead of listing events.    How will we know which ticket packages to list?  Stephane is going to set up a special venue for this new feature, with events on Mondays.  ""All.In.Vegas"".  We can look for those Monday events in that specific venue and list those.    The landing page also needs to display the dates correctly.  We normally display one event date.  For this page we will need to display the start and end date.  Monday [month] [date] through Sunday [month] [date].    If you click on one of those packages then it should take you to the Monday event page, where it will list the male and female seven-day passes.  That event page will also need to be tweaked for these packages to show both the start and end date, as opposed to only the start date like with normal tickets.

"Task","New Site - Feedback - Spherical","Hi,    here is all of spherical's comments re: the new staging site, FYI [~rporter] - Im open to feedback on suggestions from the Bytery to respond back to this with.  This is also something that will be discussed at the Thursday morning meeting.        *Overall*  Decrease the page width to accommodate short form blogs (currently is ~1100 pixels, aim for ~700 pixels) (Ex. Medium)  Look to include Instagram integration for the brand, potentially even on the individual restaurant/nightlife pages to get a better sense of the various properties and overall brand    *Restaurants/Nightlife Overview Page*  Add overview copy to the main page setting up the below restaurants and venues  Potentially organize locations by hierarchy, category, etc.  Add copy to each preview location, as you currently don't get a good sense of what these places are like until you click through    *Restaurants/Nightlife Individual Pages*  Break out locations to include a short description of the uniqueness and characteristics of each different location on the overall restaurant or venue page (this will help with the depth of content on each page to enhance SEO)  Ex. Hakkasan's page has an overall slider and description, then the page breaks out the locations with an image and short bio about each location  Add link backs to different places on the page (maybe similar locations, food types, etc.) just so there are links in addition to the primary navigation bar    Techical Crawl     Major Technical:     Crawler Access (should be blocked while in staging):  Would make all staging sites no index, no follow to avoid search engines indexing these non production versions of the site.     Mobile Site Speed Score:     Not passing.

"Task","New Site - Spherical Round 2 Feedback","based off the last round of revision, please see the below.  I was fighting the slider but lets just add it in there, Im the only fight this (as in Jo-Lene, yes me)    *From Spherical:*  +Blog Preview Page+  * I think the slider might be helpful. If we don't want to go that route, it may be helpful to add a bit of pagination (dots that show you how many more posts you have to go. The Standard does a good job with this.  * May want to have a spot for categorical navigation - click through to read all ""It's In The Details"" blog posts.   * May want to make each post adapt to full width and height of viewport (browser/device) even if user resizes browser as they are scrolling through.  * The transparent black feature behind the blog title totally covers the image. Maybe think of removing, scaling down, or making it a gradient so it doesn't have that harsh line.  * If we could get the image size that we should be using that would be great because some preview images don't look to great now due to sizing.  * The blurb text preview is really long. It almost shows the full story instead of entices the reader to click through to learn more. I'd suggest one sentence or just the blog headlines.  * The headline text is pretty big. Do we want to make it a bit smaller or mess with full left alignment or centered text?     +Individual Blog Pages+  * I definitely think we need those images that go within the individual blog posts.  * Might be worth having stylized pull quotes to break out long interviews.  * Agreed that we should have some type of suggested stories at the bottom of each blog post so users don't have to go back to the main page.
